# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various property features (e.g., location, property size, and age) using machine learning models. Accurate housing price predictions help real estate agencies and potential buyers make informed decisions by providing data-driven price estimates.

## Key Learning Points

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Libraries Used**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- Cleaned and prepared housing data by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
- Used `Pandas` and `NumPy` to transform the raw data into a structured format, ready for model training.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Libraries Used**: `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
- Conducted EDA to identify trends, correlations, and feature distributions. Used `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to visualize data relationships, such as price vs. location and price vs. square footage.
- Generated heatmaps and pair plots to explore correlations, aiding in feature selection.

### 3. Feature Engineering and Selection
- **Libraries Used**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`
- Created new features like property age and location-based metrics (e.g., proximity to amenities), enhancing model accuracy.
- Applied feature selection techniques in `scikit-learn` to retain the most influential predictors, reducing dimensionality and improving model interpretability.

### 4. Model Development and Training
- **Library Used**: `scikit-learn`
- Trained regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict housing prices.
- Compared model performance using metrics such as R² and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to identify the most effective approach for price prediction.

### 5. Model Tuning and Cross-Validation
- **Techniques Used**: Grid Search, Cross-Validation
- Performed hyperparameter tuning with `scikit-learn`'s Grid Search to optimize model parameters for improved accuracy and reliability.
- Used cross-validation to ensure robust model performance across different data splits.

### 6. Visualization of Results
- **Libraries Used**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- Visualized the final model’s performance metrics and predictions versus actual values with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, presenting insights into price trends and feature importance.
- Created interactive plots and dashboards to display price predictions, allowing stakeholders to explore different housing features and their impact on price.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of regression techniques, feature engineering, and model evaluation in a real-world context. Key learnings include data cleaning, feature creation, and effective model selection and tuning for accurate housing price prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
